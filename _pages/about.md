I am a graduate student at University of Southern California, majoring in Computer Science. My area of interest lies in the field of Machine learning and its applications. I am also fond of developing an end-to-end application with an attractive user interface.

I am currently working under Prof. Yolanda Gil and postdoctoral researcher Daniel Garijo on 'Data narratives', a Semantic Web related project, with the objective to increase the understandability of scientific workflows using their inputs, provenance, metadata, intermediate results and outputs. The project is carried out at Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer(Full-stack developer) at Intuit India Product Development Center focusing on the development and automation of infrastructure related applications. Along with the software development, I was part of Tech Study group where Machine learning projects were undertaken as unstructured-time projects.
